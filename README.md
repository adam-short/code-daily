# code-daily
An attempt to formalise my obsession - code written daily, to practise my craft.

It's not daily, precisely. Each folder is a month; and each month, I am committing to writing 15 pieces of code. 
The main languages to be used are: 
- Go 
- Ruby 
- Python
- JavaScript

Of course, there will be a lot more. The idea here is to experiment, nothing else. So there is no unifying theme.
